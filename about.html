                    <p>Description of what the group member did. Fake text for an example- Sitting in the sun, away from everyone who had done him harm in the past, he quietly listened to those who roamed by. He felt at peace in the moment, hoping it would last, but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end. He closed his eyes, the sun beating down on face and he smiled. He smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember </p>

                    <p>The Role that I decided to take on for this project was to make and design the website. For this, I learned the basics of HTML, made some designs of what I wanted to website to generally look like, then got to work. I made sure to have spaces for links to each game as well as descriptions of the games themselves. I also made sure that there was a page dedicated to the members of this group (this page) and all the hard work we have put in. As I got thinking more about the website, I wanted to keep our project organized. To do this, I decided we should have a “Project Documents” and a “Projects Schedule” page so all the information would be together. The “Project Documents” page is complete with links to download the necessary PowerPoints or Word Docs and is being updated as we complete more documents. I hope you are enjoying the website as well as the games with it!</p>
