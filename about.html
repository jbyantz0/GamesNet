                    <p>The Role that Jericho decided to take on for this project was to make and design the website. For this, he learned the basics of HTML, made some designs of what he wanted to website to generally look like, then got to work. He made sure that there was a page dedicated to the members of this group (this page) and all the hard work they have put in. We hope you are enjoying the website as well as the games on it!</p>
